                    experience and interaction out of
                    a TV moment in video clips?</h3>
                <p>The experience will mainly entertain people while watching a music video. Now music videos are 2D but how fun would it be when you watch a music video that a real stage or visuals come to life in your living room.</p>

                <h3>Apple Music</h3>
                <p>I chose Apple music as a client because it fits within the Apple ecosystem that I will largely be working in and for. This could just as easily have been Deezer, Spotify, Youtube(music) or Tidal. Platforms that make music go viral. What reinforces my choice of Apple Music is the fact that Apple is working on AR glasses, I had included that idea in my concept as well because I am convinced that when they will launch the glasses this will be a feature.</p>
